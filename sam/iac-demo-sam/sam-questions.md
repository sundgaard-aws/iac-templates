So SAM (the CLI) does not really help me with writing my IaC apart from the yaml template created by "sam init". With SAM as such I am tied to using and writing YAML by hand? If I wan't to write my IaC using dotnet or Java, I will need to use the CDK with either L1 or L2 constructs, and SAM is not meant for this?
